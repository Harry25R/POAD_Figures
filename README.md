This repo contains all code required to reproduce the results described in "Decoding the hallmarks of allograft dysfunction with a comprehensive pan-organ transcriptomic atlas".
Currently, this research contains **two** results that are currently being commercialised. 
Hence, the code required to develop genes within the data-driven global indicator of allograft dysfunction will be updated at a later date (Once the patent has been approved)
For any concerns, please contact harryr@maths.usyd.edu.au.
Happy exploring!
